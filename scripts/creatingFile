Hii this is the first file

to create a file syntax: vi filename

then editor will open then enter "i" to get into insert mode,
then write your script and enter "esc+:" then enter "wq!" to save and quit from editor.

If you write any scripting file give the file name with the extension of .sh , It is a convention you can give with out .sh extension tooo

Thank you
